    <p>In freshman year of high school, I began to work at the Brookline Interactive Group. 
      We contributed to “The Fun Show” production by editing the clips and lights. I also 
      participated in the Red Sox game recording and got the chace to interview the CEO
      of the Fenway Stadium about their methods of management. Moreover, I 
      spearheaded producing propaganda videos with team members about community benefits
      and environment protection. 
    </p>
    <p>Later, I volonteered at the Boston Medical Center and the Tufts Medical Center in the 
      Geriatric and Dermentology departments in the summer. In the process, I found that there
      are some patients with language disabilities or do not understand English as they speak another 
      language. There are also other difficulties such as patients who just came to the states do not 
      have a built in medical profile in the system. I hope that I can design a better and more accessible 
      system for the patients to use, especially those with disabilities.
